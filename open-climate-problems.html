                    <br/>

                    <p>In my career transition away from physics, it was a significant challenge for me to make my work experience relevant to the interests of climate change mitigation specialists. At the same time, climate change experts have frequently pushed "all hands on deck" messaging. I wanted to help, and was ready to give up my career, jump into action and do quite literally anything with a positive real-world impact. Who would give me a chance?</p>

                    <p>I quickly learned that I would have to generate my own opportunities, and develop my own research program in this space in order to squeeze myself in, which brought me to MIT. But I've come to understand that I am not the only scientist facing this frustrating question. In response, I have compiled a list of open problems that technically-capable people from physics, math, and machine learning backgrounds can use as inspiration for research and innovation. My own path was fraught with stress and uncertainty, so I sincerely hope I can make the transition easier for others.</p>

                    <p>For such an urgent societal problem, pivoting to a career in mitigation work was way harder than it should have been. We need to lower the barrier to entry. If you're struggling, please do not hesitate to reach out to me and ask for help. I may not have the bandwidth to develop solutions to these problems myself, but I am open to advisory roles on projects and have even gotten the ball rolling on some of them. Good luck!</p>

                    <p>Background:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soils have a phase diagram. The USDA uses the three-axis picture below to rate soil quality. It looks like a triangle, where each edge is an axis labeling the concentration of three key soil components: sand, silt, and clay. </li>
                        <li>Most plants thrive best in a happy medium of these qualities, formed by a roughly even mix of the three components. We refer to such soils as "loam" or as being "loamy." There is a good reason for this phenomenon, and it boils down to three soil characteristics:</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Machine Learning Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A variational auto-encoder or auto-regressive model for soil health.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Physics Problems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Which of the phase lines above is a true first- or second-order phase transition? It is actually empirically observed that, to good approximation, sand, silt, and clay are only differentiated by their particle size. The specific mineral content may induce subtle effects in sliminess, surface tension, viscosity, adhesion, and the like, but the main properties we care about — drainage, permeability, and retention — seem to be controlled mostly by particle size. It may be possible to answer this question in terms of the statistical physics of three populations of stacked spheres, with a hierarchy between their particle sizes. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Emergency response warnings from remote sensing data. Example: experienced sailors can look outside and perform local sensory observations to determine whether it is safe to embark on a voyage. This indicates that global velocity field information is not actually required for a coarse predictor of dangerous weather conditions. Remote sensing data from satellites, combined with observations, should be more than sufficient to develop an end-to-end early warning system which can notify people of impending unsafe weather conditions – extreme heat, cold, rain, storms, winds, etc. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Physics Problems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Derive the number of tropical cyclones per year on Earth. Empirically, we observe on the order of 100 per year, but the reasons for even this order of magnitude are not well-understood. Furthermore the dependence on radiative forcing from the sun is unclear but extremely valuable to understand – how does the number change as the Earth's average temperature increases?</li>
